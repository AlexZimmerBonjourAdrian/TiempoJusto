# Plan for Google Calendar Integration

This document outlines the plan for integrating Google Calendar with the "Tiempo Justo" application.

## Goal

To allow users to synchronize their input hours with their Google Calendar, enabling them to visualize and manage their time effectively.

## Steps

1.  **Research Google Calendar API:** Investigate the Google Calendar API to understand how to integrate with it. This includes authentication, event creation, and data synchronization.
2.  **Implement Google Authentication:** Add Google authentication to the React application. This will allow users to grant permission for the application to access their Google Calendar.
3.  **Create Event Creation Functionality:** Develop a function that takes the input hours from the application and creates corresponding events in the user's Google Calendar.
4.  **Add UI Elements for Calendar Integration:** Add UI elements (e.g., a button or checkbox) to allow users to enable/disable Google Calendar synchronization.
5.  **Implement Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where the Google Calendar API is unavailable or the user denies permission.
6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the Google Calendar integration to ensure it works as expected.
