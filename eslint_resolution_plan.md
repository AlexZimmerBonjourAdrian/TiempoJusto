# ESLint Resolution Plan

**Goal:** Address the ESLint errors caused by unused variables in `HourCalculator.js` and `TaskBoard.js`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Re-examine the ESLint configuration:** Determine how ESLint is configured to treat warnings as errors. This might involve looking at `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, or similar configuration files.
2.  **Explore options for resolving the errors:**
    *   **Option 1: Fix the code:** As I've already done, this involves removing or using the unused variables.
    *   **Option 2: Modify the ESLint configuration:** This involves either:
        *   Disabling the specific rule that flags unused variables.
        *   Configuring the rule to not treat warnings as errors.
        *   Ignoring the specific warnings for the affected files.
3.  **Choose the best approach:** Consider the trade-offs between fixing the code and modifying the ESLint configuration. Fixing the code is generally preferred, but modifying the ESLint configuration might be necessary if the variables are intentionally unused.
4.  **Implement the chosen approach:** Make the necessary changes to the code or the ESLint configuration.
5.  **Test the changes:** Run the build to verify that the ESLint errors are resolved.
6.  **Document the changes:** Explain the changes in a commit message.
